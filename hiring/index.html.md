## Definitions

Job families and vacancies are different things and can't be used interchangeably. Hopefully this information will help to clarify the differences.

- A [job family](/job-families) is a permanent item; its content is a superset of all vacancies for the job family, and it is created with a merge request.
- A [vacancy](/handbook/hiring/vacancies/) is temporary item posted on Greenhouse; its content is a subset of the job family, and it is created by copying parts of a job family based on an issue.

We don't use the word "job" to refer to a job family or vacancy because it is ambiguous.

People at GitLab can be a specialist on one thing and expert in many:

- A [specialization](/team/structure/#specialist) is specific to a job family, each team member can have only one, it defined on the relevant job family page. A specialist uses the compensation benchmark of the job family.
- An [expertise](/team/structure/#expert) is not specific to a a job family, each team member can have multiple ones, the expertises a team member has are listed on our team page.

The following parts describe what someone does at GitLab:

1. Level: Senior
1. job family: Developer
1. Specialist: Gitaly specialist
1. Location: EMEA
1. Expert: Reliability, Durability

We use the following terms to refer to a combination of the above:

- Title (level and job family, listed on the contract): Senior Developer
- Headline (all parts except expertise, listed on vacancies): Senior Developer, Gitaly specialist, EMEA

Please use the same order as in the examples above, a few notes:

- Level comes before job family.
- Specialist comes after job family and always includes 'specialist'.
- Location comes after specialization.

We preface a title with interim when we're hiring for the position.
