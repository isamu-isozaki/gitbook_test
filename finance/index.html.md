## Invoice template and where to send
<a name="invoices"></a>

Vendor and contractor invoices are to be sent to ap@gitlab.com. An [invoice
template](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eA0fOmbRysYrL4YVufRRydl2B_9UwWRtxKwKu2iTCHo) can be found in Google Docs by the name of "Invoice Template".

Contractors can send the invoice around the middle of the month to ensure payment by the end of it. Include any [expenses](/handbook/spending-company-money/) in the invoice.

In many cases, VAT will not be payable on transactions between GitLab BV and EU-based
vendors/contractors, thanks to "Shifted VAT". To make use of this shifted VAT:

* The vendor/contractor writes the phrase "VAT shifted to recipient according to
article 44 and 196 of the European VAT Directive" on the invoice along with the
VAT-number of GitLab BV (NL853740343B01).
* On the vendor's VAT return the revenue from GitLab BV goes to the rubric "Revenue within the EU". It goes without saying that vendors are responsible for their own correct and timely filings.
* GitLab BV files the VAT on the VAT return, and is generally able to deduct this VAT all as part of the same return.

### Timesheets for Hourly Employees

1. People Ops and Finance will share a private Google Sheet with you where you will log your hours for each day in the “hours” column.
1. There is a dropdown in the “pay type” column, with the default being Regular. There are also options for Overtime, Vacation, Sick, and Bereavement. Choose the appropriate pay type for your time.
1. If you work overtime or more hours than agreed upon in your contract, please obtain approval from your manager and forward to Finance before payroll cutoff.
1. Your timesheet is due one day prior to the submit payroll date, which is outlined for the calendar year on your timesheet.
