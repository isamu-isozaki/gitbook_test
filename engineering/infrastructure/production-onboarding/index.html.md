## Suggested Software Tools

As production engineers we are allowed to utilize a linux workstation.  The list
below is mostly comprised of OSX tools.  You'll need to find the linux
equivalent to match the linux distro of your choice.

In addition to the standard tools for interacting with the rest of GitLab,
the following tools help when working on production issues.

Required tools
1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
1. SSH, properly configured
1. chef, knife, berkshelf
1. kubectl (`brew install kubernetes-cli`)

Nice to have
1. iTerm (`brew cask install iterm2`)
1. A text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Textmate](https://macromates.com), [MacVim](http://macvim-dev.github.io/macvim/), or [neovim](https://neovim.io)
1. watch (`brew install watch`)
1. tmux/tmate (`brew install tmux tmate`)
1. A markdown editor such as [macdown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com) (`brew cask install macdown`)
1. gsed (`brew install gnu-sed`)

To [replace mac utilities with gnu core utilities]( https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/69223/how-to-replace-mac-os-x-utilities-with-gnu-core-utilities) use the --with-default-names option.
