## Department Initiatives
Our large and strategic customers are in need of an ongoing partnership that combines expert guidance with flexibility and adaptability to support their adoption and continuous improvement initiatives.  

These customers expect that partner to provide a streamlined, consistent and fully coordinated experience that encompasses the full span of their needs as well as the fully lifecycle of the relationship.
Need to focus on 3 main areas in order to grow in our existing accounts as well as land large and strategic:

1. Awareness
2. Adoption
3. Usage

### Initiative: Awareness

## Transition and Handoff Workflow

In an effort to capture the wider scope of customer interactions with GitLab, the flow outlined below will soon addresses the business processes involved through the entire service lifecycle and customer journey.  There is an active initiative to unify stages, phases, titles, names, etc led by Marketing and Sales.

## Responsibility Matrix and Transitions

The table below depicts the relationships between activities, responsible roles, relationship and opportunity stages in the customer lifecycle.  A more detailed in the [responsibility assignment matrix (RACI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) format will be an critical tool for every GitLab customer.

## Customer Success Data Management

Customer names, customer information security and NDA compliance are critical concerns for Customer Success, since we communicate with customers every day. All issues managing work as it relates to prospects and customers must be private and confidential. Work should be managed only in approved GitLab projects and never within private repositories. GitLab employee-only accessible projects for work management include:

* [us-public-sector](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/us-public-sector) parent project for all public sector work
* [account-management](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/account-management/) parent project for account-specific work and collaboration with the rest of sales
* [customer-success](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success) parent project for Customer Success employee, shared or triage work

### Customer Success Metrics

We currently have a [Customer Success Metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/customer-success/cs-metrics) Project within GitLab. This project is used to requesting new reports, dashboards and suggesting new metrics that we may need for the department. 

This will sometimes be cross-referenced with a data & analytics project that is located [here](https://gitlab.com/meltano/looker/issues).

### Optimized Account Growth Program

In order to evangelize and grow the use of GitLab in existing accounts, the [Optimized Account Growth Program](/handbook/customer-success/optimized-account-growth-program) has been developed to facilitate collaborative sessions and workshops within customer environments. The program is intended to improve the partnership between GitLab and the customer, solving complex business problems while reducing cycle times and improving workflow, ultimately resulting in the growth in adoption and usage of GitLab in customer environments.

### Customer Success & Market Segmentation
For definitions of the account size, refer to [market segmentation](/handbook/sales#market-segmentation) which is based on the _Potential EE Users_ field on the account.

- Strategic: Sr. Account Executive closed deal and stays on account for growth and renewal.  Solutions Architect is assigned pre-sales and stays on the account to help with adoption and growth.
- Large: Sr. Account Executive closed deal and stays on account for growth and renewal.  Solutions Architect is assigned pre-sales and stays on the account to help with adoption and growth.
- Mid-Market: Account Executive closes deal and transfers to Account Manager to handle renewals and growth. The Account Manager records the Previous Account Owner on the Opportunity Group in any deals while the account is in the New Customer period within the first 12 months including the first annual renewal.
- SMB: Web Portal with Sales Admin oversight.
