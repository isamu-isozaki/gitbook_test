title: Community Advocate Onboarding Checklist
---

This should be located in your general onboarding issue in the [PeopleOps employement issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/employment/issues). This list looks strange in this handbook because it is formatted to be copy-pasted into an issue and then render properly there.

The topics are generally ordered by priority in which they need to be tackled,
but feel free to work on later things in the list when you are waiting on something.
